# Jupyter Notebook specific exclusions

*.ipynb           # Exclude all .ipynb files if you don't want to track them.
                  # If you DO want to track some .ipynb files, uncomment the line below
                  # and then explicitly track them using `git add -f path/to/your/notebook.ipynb`.
                  # A better approach for tracking notebooks while ignoring outputs is often
                  # to use `nbstripoutput` or a similar tool.

# For notebooks you *do* want to track, but want to ignore their output:
# You can use tools like `nbstripoutput` or `git-lfs` for large outputs.
# If you run `nbstripoutput --install` it will set up a git filter that
# cleans outputs before committing. In that case, you don't need to ignore
# the .ipynb files themselves.

# If you prefer to manually strip outputs before committing:
# Find and replace "outputs": [] with an empty list in your .ipynb JSON.

# Virtual environment
# This is a common place for virtual environments. Adjust if yours is elsewhere.
